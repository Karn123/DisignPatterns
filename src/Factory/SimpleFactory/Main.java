 * This Simple Factory example demonstrates that there's exactly only one factory,
 * here we call it local factory which can produce different kinds of pizzas.It now
 * works perfect.
 * However, if we want to eat pizzas from different cities means we have to add a
 * new factory such as NewYorkPizza Factory, ChicagoPizzaStore. What's worse is
 * that we have to new different object of factories if we want to eat pizza from
 * different cities.
 *
 * For example:
 * NewYorkPizzaFactory nyPizzaFactory = new NewYorkPizzaFactory();
 * Pizza pizza = nyPizzaFactory.createPizza(pizzaType);
 * ChicagoPizzaStore chicagoPizzaFactory = new ChicagoPizzaStore();
 * Pizza chicagoPizza = chicagoPizzaFactory.createPizza(pizzaType);
 *
 * Every time we want to eat a pizza from a new city, we have to add a factory and
 * create it in the main(), which means we have to modify the creation part of factory
 * in main(), and that violates the OCP(Open for extension but closed for modification).
 * So we should use the Abstract Factory Design Pattern to make the factory creation
 * without modify the creation of the factory every time we want to eat pizza made in a
 * new factory or a new city.
